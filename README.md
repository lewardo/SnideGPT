## the sarcastic "assistant"üî•

Simple interface for a digital assistant that insults you and answers sarcastically, built for the _HackSheffield 8_ hackathon, aimed at the funniest hack, most ducktaped hack, best use of google cloud and best domain name registration.
The wake-word is appropriately 'yo bro', or there is also a model in the './models' directory for the wakeword 'oi megamind', both in the spirit of sarcasm
